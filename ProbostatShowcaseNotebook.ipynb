Sensors did not necessarily all start to measure from the same point in time, nor did they finish at the same point in time, leading to a lot of `NaN` (\"Not a number\") values in the table and to crashing. That's why we stitch them back here in the `brlopack` Python package (and for the usecase thus far, we could always assume that Probostat's `.csv` files always need to be stitched)\n",
